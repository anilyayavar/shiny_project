# 120 Years of Olympics

## INTRODUCTION

This is a dashboard prepared by me as part of capstone project learning both shiny and presenting visualisations on custom dashboards. 
Several Visualisations have been prepared depicting journey of both version of olympic games -

- Summer Olympics
- Winter Olympics

Users of this dashboard may scroll/navigate through various pages of visualisations available as page menu and further divided in tabsets in some pages.

Source: 1. I have used the historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games available on kaggle at [this link](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results), including all the Games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016. I could not find the data related to Tokyo Olympics 2020.

2. Flag iconsets of countries, used on axis of charts have been used from ["http://www.senojflags.com"](http://www.senojflags.com).

**Note** that the Winter and Summer Games were held in the same year up until 1992. After that, they staggered them such that Winter Games occur on a four year cycle starting with 1994, then Summer in 1996, then Winter in 1998, and so on. A common mistake people make when analyzing this data is to assume that the Summer and Winter Games have always been staggered.
